# Preparing a Presentation for a Thesis / Project

## Duration
For the presentation aim for 7-15 minutes and any extra time you might need to do a live demo if this fits your work.

## Content
You will not be able to present everything you did. Focus on the most important contributions. In fact, being able to extract the essential and present it in an understandable manner is a skill. In particular make sure that you present
- the problem that you're solving and why is it a problem
- the solution that you came with (if you have a demo this is the point where you show the demo; make sure to rehearse the demo; and take your time to use realistic interactions, i.e. no "foo-bar" examples)
- a good discussion of the pros, cons, and limitations of your solution; this is the point where you can also add discussion points that are not in the submitted report but that you thought about since the submission; however, make sure 
- a good discussion about the future work; in a sense, doing a good job in the future work shows that you're now an expert in the domain to the point where not only you understand the limitations of your solution but expertise is also proven by being able to point future important directions of work 


If you have more topics to discuss than what fits in 15 minutes discuss with your supervisor. 

Alternatively, transform some of the aspects of your work that you would like to talk about into backup slides. If during the discussion a question is raised about these aspects you can bring up the extra slides and use them to illustrate your discussion. 

## Other Observations

Put slide numbers on slides. This allows for the audience to ask you to "go back to slide number X" for clarifications. 

**The last slide** is sometimes the one that stays the most on the screen. It is nice if it's a visual summary of the whole presentation. It is bad if it's just a "Thank you!". You already said "thank you", you don't have to write it also.
