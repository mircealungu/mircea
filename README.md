Mircea Lungu is associate professor in computer science at theÂ [IT University of Copenhagen](https://en.itu.dk/research). Before coming to Denmark he was assistant professor at theÂ [Faculty of Science and Engineering](http://www.rug.nl/research/fmns/?lang=en)Â ofÂ [University of Groningen](http://www.rug.nl/)Â where he was a member of theÂ [SEARCH](http://www.cs.rug.nl/search/)Â research group and theÂ [Data Science Pioneers](http://www.rug.nl/research/fmns/themes/dssc/)Â group. He was also part time visiting researcher in theÂ [SWAT](https://www.cwi.nl/research-groups/software-analysis-and-transformation)Â group atÂ [CWI in Amsterdam](https://www.cwi.nl/). Before that he was postdoc at theÂ [University of Bern](http://scg.unibe.ch/)Â in Switzerland, and for six months, visiting researcher atÂ [IBM TJ Watson Research Center](http://www.watson.ibm.com/index.shtml)Â in New York. He got his PhD working withÂ [Michele Lanza](http://www.inf.usi.ch/lanza/)Â and the REVEAL research group at theÂ [University of Lugano](http://www.inf.usi.ch/), in Switzerland. His interests are in software visualization, tools for software evolution, human computer interaction, and personalized learning environments.



# Research Interests
- [Software Visualization](directions/visualization.md)
- [Empirical Studies in Software Engineering](directions/empirical-studies.md) 
- [Tools for Supporting Software Evolution](directions/tools-for-evolution.md)
- [Personalized Learning Environments](directions/personalized-learning-environments.md) 
- [Fighting Social Media Addiction](projects/aiki.md) 


# Research Prototypes 
I always loved and I still love coding. However, nowadays I'm more of a product owner that guides and advises talented groups of students that create and evaluate innovative prototypes. Some of these projects are: 
- [Git-Truck](projects/git-truck.md) - visualizing git repositories for fun and profit
- [Flask Monitoring Dashboard](projects/flask-monitoring-dashboard.md) - a lightweight API monitor for Flask/Python systems 
- [ArchLens](projects/ArchLens.md) -  helps developers track the evolution of the structure of their systems 
- [Zeeguu](projects/zeeguu.md) - personalized adaptive reading and vocabulary practice online
- [Aiki](projects/aiki.md) - a browser extension that uses procrastination for good
- [Dansk-in-Town](projects/dansk-in-town.md) - an app for gamifying vocabulary learning in town
- [MathsCamp](projects/maths-camp.md) - personalized maths for kids

# Notes, Thoughts

As of spring 2024, I just had a new idea I'm trying a new experiment: instead of posting my random ideas on social platforms I just dump them on a separate page that I call my [thoughtstream](thoughtstream.md). This way, whomever might fancy to sample my assorted ideas does not have to see them interleaved with ads and dancing cats.

Some more assorted notes: 
[Importance-of-Maintenance](notes/Importance-of-Maintenance.md) // [How-to-Read-a-Research-Paper](notes/How-to-Read-a-Research-Paper.md) // [Good-Code-Is-Readable](notes/Good-Code-Is-Readable.md)   //  [A-Performance-Problem](notes/A-Performance-Problem.md)  // [The-Badly-Designed-Everyday-Things](notes/The-Badly-Design-of-Everyday-Things.md) | [Book-Reviews](notes/Book-Reviews.md) | // [ChatGPT-and-CoPilot](notes/ChatGPT-and-CoPilot.md) //  [Import-boilerplate-in-react](essays/import-boilerplate.md) 


# Student Projects
If you're interested in a student project, look at the prototypes and directions listed above and see whether you'd like to contribute to any of them. At the end of each, there are several ideas of possible future directions.

You can also look at the [list of projects available on GitHub](https://github.com/mircealungu/student-projects/) - for more other ideas. Use this list more as a hint at the kinds of projects I'm interested in. If you have an idea that is similar, we can still discuss. But if it's very far, then I won't be able to supervise you. 

 Also, when contacting me for a project please **send me 0) your degree programme 1) a recent CV, 2) a transcript of your grades, and 3) a link to your GitHub repository**. This helps me understand what are your strengths and weaknesses and guide you towards more appropriate projects. 
 
 If you're curious about how a thesis with me might look like, you can find several past [Thesis-Examples](notes/Thesis-Examples.md) on this website.
