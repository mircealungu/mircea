methodology
- if you're going to evaluate something with users that is a survey or that it's a tool you must do a pilot test because your mental model is not the same as the one of the users and if you don't do that then you'll have bad surprises.

reporting
- if you create a dataset you must share it; discuss with your supervisor 

Thematic analysis
- traceability between your themes and the quotes
