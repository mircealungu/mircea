I'm on a plane, and want to access some files from two years ago. I can not, however, because mac os "optimizes" the space on my machine and for some reason decided that these files must stay "in the cloud". 

I have half a TB of space on my Disk. 

And I have, explicitly opted out of this stupid feature before. (not without adventures)

I wonder how did the option become active again. Did they reset my preference with some new version of the OS? 

This seems like theft in some sense. They hid my files without me asking for it. 

I wonder why do they do this? Is it a way to "fill" one's cloud storage such that later they can come to sell you more storage? 

Whatever this is, that I never wanted to have this feature, I deactivated it in the past, and I find myself having it enabled again, angers me. Makes me want to sue Apple. 

Or move to Linux as DHH did when he got upset with the big company.
