I've decided that I must write short notes about the books I read. I'll try to keep them here.

gulag archipelago

- the soviet paranthesis inthe history of russia

- 




## Dominion, Tom Holland
Notes
- In the story of Job, "the court of God" seems to be inspired by the court of Cyrus the Great - an emperror that the jews admired because he freed them from their babilonian captivity; even Satan is modeled by the approach Cyrus would have of sending messengers across the empire
- Satan literally means "the adversary" in Hebrew
- The tower of Babbel story was probably inspired by the Babilonian ziggurat of Marduk that the Jewis saw in their exile

## 2023

## How to Win Friends and Influence People, D. Carnegie
- startd Feb
- audiobook
- i read this when i was in highschool, and all i remember from it was the principle of "you should never eat alone"; recently spurred by a review from one of my friends i decided to see how does it feel 20 years late
- chapter 1: nobody thinks about themselves of being wrong (not even al capone, and not even death-row criminals); so think twice before trying to convince that they are wrong

## The History of Western Philosophy, by Bertrand Russel
- started Feb
- re-reading this after I've read it last year in audio form and didn't remain with much; trying to see whether reading on paper results in better retention

## The Dark Forest, Cixin Liu
- Jan, audio
- the book is in a sense better than the previous one; galaxy-scale and centuries-scale science fiction, that still succeeds in following a "reluctant" protagonist (Luo Ji)
- the book has a huge suspense arc if one knows the dark forest theory.  indeed, the solution of Luo Ji is in some sense quite obvious, and once it is set in motion, one can only be eager to see whether it works. (although now I start to wonder whether in a dark forrest, one ever starts an expedition like the one of the trisolarians...)
- the alien attack is awe-inspiring - one of the most vivid descriptions of a first encounter with a superior technology that I ever read
- towards the end there is a bit of a disappointing deus-ex-machina


## 2022 

## The Three Body Problem , Cixin Liu
- October, audio
- Learning about the "struggle sessions" during the Chinese cultural revolution; scary how much harm and misery can be brought about by people with good intentions; impressive to see the madness of the crowds; interesting to see glimpses of that on social media; social media really is the 'wild west'
- In parts the book seems too longwinded; some of the motivations of the characters are not convincing; some of the plot feels a bit cartoonish rather than science-fiction
- Didn't make me want to read the second part



## The Coddling of the American Mind: How Good Intentions and Bad Ideas Are Setting Up a Generation for Failure
- J. Haidt G. Lukianoff
- September, audio
- Very well written 
- I liked the fact that they start with the goal of understanding the new generation rather than from the premise of judging 
- The initial parable of the wise man in a cave in Greece is memorable
