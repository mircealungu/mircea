why do we have a crysis of meaning? interview between alex connor and john vervaeke

how did we get here?

my own hypotheses:

- we're doing too well; it's hard to do a fight at the top of the maslow's pyramid of needs; for a long time, people were struggling to cover the bases; 
- we have lost our story; it used to be about
	- achieving the next life (the christian dream) 
	- achieving a good life (the american dream)
- we don't believe in any of those two anymore becauese
	- the first - 
- we don't believe in authority anymore - and for good reason maybe - authority has been proven to mislead; church; state; 
- 

- changes are happening too fast for our culture to adapt;
