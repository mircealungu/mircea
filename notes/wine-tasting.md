oct 27

Yesterday evening wine tasting. 
Pinot Noir - a bit too flat.
Chianti - a bit too superficial. Might have not been aired it enough: the alcohol was a bit too obvious. 
Chateau Neuf du Pape - nice. a broader spectrum of flavor then the ones before. 
Spanish Crianza - Ribera del Duero - this was nice. Crianza = aged before bottling. Increasing order of maturation: crianza, riserva, gran riserva. 
Mentor - Portughese Doura DOC Red 2021 - a nice surprise. Really nice flavour. 
Primitivo de Manduria - this was the nicest of the evening. Sweeter than the others. Fruity flavour. [this one](https://www.megavin.dk/stilio-primitivo-di-manduria-mottura)
