# Student Projects

Please read attentively the notes below before contacting me. We are all saving time if you do so. 

## Introduction email

 When contacting me, send me an email that includes "Thesis Project" in the title and includes the following: 
 
 0) your degree programme, 
 1) a recent CV, 
 2) a transcript of your grades, and 
 3) a link to your GitHub repository

This helps me understand what are your strengths and weaknesses and guide you towards more appropriate projects. 

## Project Topics

If you're interested in a student project, look at the prototypes and directions listed on my [homepage](../README.md) and see whether you'd like to contribute to any of them. At the end of each, there are several ideas of possible future directions. It's important that you find an already existing project to contribute to rather than start a new one because these are already maintained by me. This means that if you do a good job, your code will end up being useful, much more likely than 

You can also look at the [list of projects available on GitHub](https://github.com/mircealungu/student-projects/) - for more other ideas. Use this list more as a hint at the kinds of projects I'm interested in. If you have an idea that is similar, we can still discuss. But if it's very far, then I won't be able to supervise you. 
## Collaboration with Companies

My default answer is no for supervisions where you work for a company. The only exceptions are if:

- There is a clear research question that is relevant and publishable in one of the software engineering or human-computer interaction conferences; and that if the work turns out well, the company is ok with publishing the research (evidently after anonymization of any relevant data)
- You put me in contact with somebody responsible at the company (e.g. CTO) that can explain to me that the problem is something that the company really cares about; I've done "work" in the past for some middle manager that had some idea, and then a student spent a whole thesis on it, only to find out in the end that it wasn't that important after all. 

## Thesis Examples

 If you're curious about how a thesis with me might look like, you can find several past [Thesis-Examples](notes/Thesis-Examples.md).
