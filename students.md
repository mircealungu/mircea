# Student Projects
If you're interested in a student project, look at the prototypes and directions listed above and see whether you'd like to contribute to any of them. At the end of each, there are several ideas of possible future directions.

You can also look at the [list of projects available on GitHub](https://github.com/mircealungu/student-projects/) - for more other ideas. Use this list more as a hint at the kinds of projects I'm interested in. If you have an idea that is similar, we can still discuss. But if it's very far, then I won't be able to supervise you. 

 Also, when contacting me for a project please **send me 0) your degree programme 1) a recent CV, 2) a transcript of your grades, and 3) a link to your GitHub repository**. This helps me understand what are your strengths and weaknesses and guide you towards more appropriate projects. 
 
 If you're curious about how a thesis with me might look like, you can find several past [Thesis-Examples](notes/Thesis-Examples.md) on this website.
