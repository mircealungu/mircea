**Aiki** is a martial arts principle that allows a practitioner to redirect an opponent's power back against themselves. 

Aiki is also a browser extension that considers social media (and other time-wasting websites) as the oponent that needs to be fought back against.

This project helps an internet user take advantage of their habits of visiting time-wasting web sites and consider the (often involuntary) impulses of visiting the said websites as a reminder for doing something useful, e.g. learning Danish or getting better at programming in Python. What is useful for each user, it is up to them to decide.

## Aiki @ CHI 2023

Nanna, Bjørn, John and I have a new paper on Aiki at CHI'23: [**Challenges and Opportunities of Using Redirection of Activity for Self-Regulation Online**](../docs/assets/papers/Aiki-CHI23.pdf)

It investigates how Aiki 2.0 -- an improved version of Aiki in terms of usability -- fares to help people drop procrastination and instead learn programming with the help of micro-learning activities. 

Another awesome video directed by Nanna that presents the highlights of the paper:

## Aiki @ CHI 2021
[Nanna Inie](https://pure.itu.dk/en/persons/nanna-inie) directed an amazing video showcasing Aiki for our CHI'21 presentation.

The corresponding paper with Nanna Inie, [**Aiki: Turning Procrastination into Microlearning**](../docs/assets/papers/Aiki-CHI21.pdf) shows that: 
- People who want to learn Danish can use redirection from time-wasting-websites as a strategy and cue to remember that they should learn
 - Participants learned quite a bit of Danish and some of them actually found the learning a better use of their time than the 'mindless' scrolling on Facebook

A think tank has [recommended a time limit](https://substack.com/redirect/3f85e91d-10e2-4ee2-afb5-3cbe9e45b8f1?j=eyJ1IjoiMWZrZzVjIn0.Fa_XmdYtdc15xoYJP6e1l7sHUPzT_gPyKZ61VI7dhe4) on **children’s social media access**. The recommendation is based on research showing that excessive social media use can lead to unhappiness. The think tank also pointed out that children can be exposed to violent content on social media and made 11 recommendations to tackle the problem. In Denmark the Minister of Culture has supported the proposals, and will discuss them with his Nordic counterparts on May 3rd. He also argues that effective age verification should be introduced at the EU level.
