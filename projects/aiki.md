**Aiki** is a martial arts principle that allows a practitioner to redirect an opponent's power back against themselves. 

Aiki is also a browser extension that considers social media (and other time-wasting websites) as the oponent that needs to be fought back against.

This project helps an internet user take advantage of their habits of visiting time-wasting web sites and consider the (often involuntary) impulses of visiting the said websites as a reminder for doing something useful, e.g. learning Danish or getting better at programming in Python. What is useful for each user, it is up to them to decide.

## Aiki @ CHI 2023

Nanna, Bjørn, John and I have a new paper on Aiki at CHI'23: [**Challenges and Opportunities of Using Redirection of Activity for Self-Regulation Online**](../docs/assets/papers/Aiki-CHI23.pdf)

It investigates how Aiki 2.0 -- an improved version of Aiki in terms of usability -- fares to help people drop procrastination and instead learn programming with the help of micro-learning activities. 

Another awesome video directed by Nanna that presents the highlights of the paper:

## Aiki @ CHI 2021
[Nanna Inie](https://pure.itu.dk/en/persons/nanna-inie) directed an amazing video showcasing Aiki for our CHI'21 presentation.

The corresponding paper with Nanna Inie, [**Aiki: Turning Procrastination into Microlearning**](../docs/assets/papers/Aiki-CHI21.pdf) shows that: 
- People who want to learn Danish can use redirection from time-wasting-websites as a strategy and cue to remember that they should learn
 - Participants learned quite a bit of Danish and some of them actually found the learning a better use of their time than the 'mindless' scrolling on Facebook

## Future Work
- Short Term
	- generalize the extension
		- remove the hardcoded redirections to either language websites or programmig; let people redirect to whatever they like
	- publish the extesion 
		- publish also for Firefox besides Chrome
		- make the backend ready for publication
- Design a large scale in-the-wild expertiment 
- Longer Term
	- implement interceptions also on mobile devices
