# Past Projects

I keep telling my students, software is like *performance art*. 
You're either there to see it while it runs. 
Or you might at best see a screencast about it.
Or read a story about how it worked. 

The projects on this page are projects that I've been involved with but are discontinued and neither I nor anybody else is maintaining them. 

- [Softwarenaut](softwarenaut.md) - interactive visual exploration of software architecture
- **SPO** - Small Project Observatory - interactive visual exploration of software ecosystems 
- **Polite Smalltalk** - an experiment with a Smalltalk that wanted to be even closer to natural language than the original Smalltalk
- [Dansk-in-Town](projects/dansk-in-town.md) - an app for gamifying vocabulary learning in town
