## Examples of Usage

Looking at student projects: 
- [Spotting Badly Structured Systems](git-truck/spotting-badly-structured-systems.md) 
- [Understanding Code Organization](git-truck/understanding-code-organization.md)
- [Quickly Comparing Complexity of Two Systems](git-truck/comparing-complexity.md)

Learning from open source: 
- [Typescript: Investigating a Compiler](git-truck/typescript-investigating-a-compiler.md)
- [Flask: Why call it a micro-web-framework?](git-truck/flask-why-micro-web-framework.md)


## Papers

1. **[Git-Truck: Hierarchy-Oriented Visualization of Git Repository Evolution](/docs/assets/papers/22-Git-Truck.pdf)** - a paper in which we show 
	- how git-truck works
	- results of an async user evaluation that shows which users benefit the most from such a tool and in which way

2. **[Can Git Visualization Support Educators in Assessing Group Projects?](/docs/assets/papers/22-Git-Vis-4Edu.pdf)** - a paper which
	- argues that educators are a special kind of user for repository visualization, and lists some of their specific needs
	- shows with examples the kinds of information educators can gain by using Git-Truck


## Future Work
- comment analysis to support module understanding
- add plugins for language-specific analysis - especially dependency analysis
