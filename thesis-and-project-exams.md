# Structure of a Thesis / Project Exam

A thesis and a project presentation are very similar at ITU. They have the following structure: 

- 2min: Welcome, introductions, explaining exam
- 7-15 min: Presentation. Read the [preparing-a-presentation](preparing-a-presentation.md) for how to prepare the presentation. If it's a group project the presentation is done by all the members of the group. 
- Rest of the time: Questioning by the examiners. For groups: the examiners will track the individual contributions to the discussion, but the whole group will be in the room all the time by default; ask if you want individual examinations in this part.  
- 5-10min: Grade deliberation & Feedback

## Questioning by the Examiners

For the thesis the questions are more focused on the research component. How well did you answer your research question is important. In fact, even the phrasing of the research question might turn out to be a discussion topic. Is it well thought out. The related work is also important, it shows that you know the domain and it definitely is a way of showing your expertise. Finally, the methodology is discussed, and then also your results. 

in a project the focus on the scientific contribution is less important.
